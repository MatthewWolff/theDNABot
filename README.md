# Twitter Python Bot
The purpose of this bot is to serve as an interactive translator for those seeking to turn words into a DNA Sequence.
The bot works by utilizing an R script which calls upon a codon table to translate any given letter into its respective amino acid, represented by a 3 nucleotide sequence. It's initally converted into RNA, and then DNA complement of that RNA sequence is taken, yielding the DNA template strand. The script also figures out the complement to that strand (the coding strand).
